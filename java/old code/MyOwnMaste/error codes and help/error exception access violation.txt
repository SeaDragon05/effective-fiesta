So, you may have tried something new, and it broke making you panic with no direct answer as to whatthef*** went wrong.

Whatthef*** went wrong?

This error is what bad data will result in. This error was most likely caused by bad or incomplete mesh data that leads to the gpu attempting to 
access non-existant data from the system RAM. Primarly, unset or null values.

If you skim through the error report and see similar lines of pure unreadable chaos on the screen as shown here, congratulations! 
You can get help without going on the internet!

As we can see, there were attempts (or calls) to read memory that is not set. For this specific example, I created a mesh that had incomplete
 mesh data, primairly missing/null normal values. Each empty and/or null memory address is supposed to be just that.

MAKE SURE FIRST THAT YOUR MODELS EXPORTED CORRECTLY!!! Or make sure THAT YOU WROTE YOUR MESHES CORRECTLY!
If something still isn't working, make sure that you are exporting with blenders OBJ file format with the checkmark "export selected" enabled.
Also, make sure, if using blender, that you are using the "triangulate" modifier BEFORE exporting
