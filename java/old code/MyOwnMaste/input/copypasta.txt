You are NOT PERMITTED or ALLOWED to tell me how or what to feel. You FAIL to look at the CONTEXT for which the remark was made. BY questioning and judging MY “hopes” or feelings about that situation, being “outraged“ by my opinion or feelings DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO ADVOCATE FOR TERRORIZING ABORTION CLINICS which was EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING. That man was carrying a loaded weapon to protest abortion which suggests ONLY ONE THING, that man had ILL INTENT TO KILL A PROVIDER AND/OR A PATIENT AND YOU KNOW IT. I STAND BEHIND MY COMMENT AND POST IN THAT HE GOT INSTANT KARMA, and exactly what he deserved. I don’t owe you ANY explanation as to WHY I feel the way I do. STOP YOUR HYPOCRITICAL VIRTUE SIGNALING. YOU CANT MANDATE AND CONTROL PEOPLES FEELINGS. NOT EVERYONE IS THE SAME RELIGION AND YOU ARE BEING A RELIGIOUS BIGOT NOW TO TRY TO ATTEMPT TO TELL ME WHAT TO FEEL AND IF IT IS WRONG OR NOT . HOW DARE YOU! Your comment is HYPOCRITICAL AT BEST. I’ll BET if we all WENT ON YOUR PAGE/PROFILE and reviewed YOUR comment history we would likely find more than a few things much much WORSE than what I had hoped would happen to someone trying to attack an abortion clinic. If you want to be petty, keep in mind that others can take offense TO YOU TOO ,this is a private group and to come in here and HARASS an oppressed group (such as us) makes you low-level and no better than the OPPRESSORS AND VIOLENT TERRORISTS YOU DEFEND. For all we know you probably ARE ONE (terrorist): but what I will NOT do is allow you to come in here and attempt to intimidate the users who are having a private discussion. Your diminished intellect certainly suggests so. YOU IGNORE THE FACT THAT ANTI-CHOICE EXTREMISTS ARE KNOWN TERRORISTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE A HISTORY OF KILLING ABORTION PROVIDERS WITH GUN VIOLENCE. My assessment is that you DID NOT read the article because your reading comprehension skills are probably WAY BELOW PAR and you have absolutely NO understanding of the REALITY of ANTI-CHOICE PROTESTERS HARASSING AND TERRORIZING CLINICS AND THEIR PATIENTS . THEY KILL ABORTION DOCTORS WITH THEIR GUNS YOU IGNORANT DOLT, MY COMMENT WAS JUSTIFIED DUE TO CONTEXT. Your comment is RIDICULOUS because you are comparing the feelings of someone YOU DO NOT KNOW to someone else WHO ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED VIOLENCE AGAINST AN ABORTION CLINIC WITH A LOADED GUN LIKELY WITH INTENT TO KILL. Be outraged at the gunman not MY reaction if you want to advocate for something benevolent, but that’s not your intent, ALL YOURE DOING IS VIRTUE SIGNALING. Comparing MY reaction to THEIR attempted violence is MORONIC and you are OBVIOUSLY advocating for more gun violence against abortion clinics. WE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU EXTREMISTS TO STIFLE WOMENS RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE WONT ALLOW YOU TO STIFLE OUR VOICES FOR EXPRESSING OUTRAGE OF GUN VIOLENCE AT ABORTION CLINICS , THAT IS OUR FIRST AMMENDMENT RIGHTS TO FREE SPEECH, You seem mentally unstable perhaps you should CHECK YOUR MEDS. .You don’t have to like my feelings but attacking ME and advocating for gun violence in this context is CONTRARIAN and EXACTLY the kind of attitude that got our capitol attacked. At least I just express outrage in an appropriate forum with like minds, YOU assholes and that jerk with the gun attack the Capitol don’t you! GTFOOH When you post in groups you don’t belong, you can expect backlash, I will NOT retract my comment and YOU CAN GO OFF RIGHT ON OFF.
When you kill Hitler and saw he looks NOTHING like Hitler. You spend weeks in 1918, searching for reasons. You take up painting. You try to find purpose. It was a one way ticket, but for what? Where is Hitler? You killed an innocent man!

Months drag on. Your facial hair grows unkempt. You become an eccentric artist until you meet a woman named Ava. You go to shave for your date.

It hits you as you approach the stache. With trembling, terrified hands, you shave one side of the stache, then the next. It's the Chaplin, you lie to yourself as you stare into the mirror. It's like a photograph you have seen a thousand times. The face of your target. The face of evil.
You realize the Agency didn't send you back to kill Hitler.
So, I gotta admit, I don't know jack shit about inflation when it comes to money. What I do know, however, is that once upon a time you could buy a candy bar for 10¢ and that shit is like $3.50 these days. Money is losing its value over time. This means you gotta work harder, right? I mean, shit, boomers back in the day were buying houses in their 20s. Can't do that now. So what the hell is a motherfucker with an art degree supposed to do? Those things are pretty useless as you'll find out by spending any amount of time on the internet. The poor guys are ruthlessly mocked because they wanted to have a little fun in university. No matter. The point of living is making money nowadays, should've figured that out earlier, sucker. Except there's a simple solution to this terrible problem: fetish art. And when it comes to fetish art, the weak must die. Artists who are uncomfortable drawing that shit had better suck it up or get poorer and poorer. One of the most popular fetishes is, in fact, inflation. Inflation fetish art generally depicts a subject getting blown up, or made fatter over time. I can only assume this stems from Americans trying their hardest to make their ever-growing obesity problem sexy. Our poor, poor artist friends have to suffer through drawing this shit to make money. In conclusion: inflation makes prices grow, which means people have to work harder, which means our dear artist friends have to draw inflation. Ironic, right? Listen, I have no idea if this is how inflation works, the economy is a fucking mystery to me because the school system doesn't tell you shit and the internet will leave you confused and twitching in rage, but if I have completely misunderstood either of these topics I know one thing for sure. This stuff is connected, like everything. The universe is an ever-growing ouroboros of bullshit. Such is life.
No.
They sent Hitler.
Ya see Donny Pizzaface got his name from da night he was born. As da legend goes, his muthuh, gawd rest her sowl, was in labuh foh about sixteen howas. Strong woman, mrs. Pizzerino, dey don't make women like her anymoah. Anyway, the docs had tuh eat, right? So they orduhed some pizzas, bein a doc is a tiyuhsome jahb. Da doc, he den realizes it's time fuh da baby to come, so he's yellin "push push!" And mrs. Pizzerino she's screamin and all dat. Heah little Donny, he comes out lookin like a sauced meatball all slippery and whatnot. Da doc takes him ovah to da bassinet aftah he's outta theah. Now, Donnys all lubed up like an engine in a camaro, and slips right outta da docs fingahs! Da doc tries tah grab him but Donny shoots outta his hands like a bahttle rahcket and lands face down in dah Pizza! Dat Pizza saved his life because da rest of da room was covahd in spikes! If he landed anywhea else he'da been a gonah. E’s a lucky boy dat Donny Pizzaface. Got out of a few bloody brawls with nothing moah den a few nicks. Walked away from some nasty cah crashes without a care in da wuhld. So dat concludes dah story of how Ol Donny Pizzaface got his name and became dah man we all luhve and raspect to dis day.
