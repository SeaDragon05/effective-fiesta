What is in a name? some one asks. Who knows! shouted that one annoying kin from the back who does not know their own good.
Perhaps someone else whould know the answer here? anyone? suggested the teacher.
Everyone,
There will be no class today because I have caught a cold. I have uploaded the presentation/lesson from Monday. I will upload demonstration videos today for the labs this week, please remember that the last lab of week 6 is on your own which means no demonstration video. Due to me being sick I will not take late points of assignments this week. Make sure to check canvas for the lecture video(s) on canvas.
I have also posted the recording and lesson from last Monday. Sorry for the delay, zoom was having difficulties.
I will see all of you next Monday. I hope that you have a good weekend. 
Also my teacher talks like a cat girl from anime from time to time which is not fun.
