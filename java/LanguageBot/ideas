create a method that can read and write from files
when it reads a file, store that information to a variable

each word learned will have a list of commonly used words after its use
this is to create sentences. For example, when the word "the" is used, only a certain list of words can be used
one word is "what", creating a short 2 worded sentence as "the what". but because that the word "what" can have so many uses,
we must end the sentence or risk creating a sentence that makes no sense. there is another list that checks the previous used word
to help decide what comes next. For the sentence "what was", what comes to mind? that? this? it? Im sure you can come up with a few more,
but for the sake of this, we check "was".
the word "was" is past tense, which narrows the choices we make.



the bot will first learn. using tweets made by actual users, we can create a data base of how people speak.
one way to approach this is to have it identify commonly used word structors.
we start with a list of all words that are used to start a sentence. there are many which makes it for a more
unpredictable outcome.

when the word is chosen, we search this word to see what is commonly used after it, or choose subjects and connect words.

to better understand this concept, lets use the beginning word "what".
this word allows us to virtualy create any sentence we want in an asking or exclamind or even a confused state.

So far the tweet is "what"

to add on, lets search "what"

commonly to begin questions, it is a statment of asking for understanding.

so, lets choose a subject. lobsters.

lets build the sentence to asking what are lobsters.
searching up the word lobsters, we know that it is a nown, and plural.
and the "bridge" words we can use are: "are" and "is"

since it is plural, we use "are"

"What are lobsters"

we have a nice tweet.

but what about commonly used words?

"this"

"place"

"is"

"good"
